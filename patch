 =head1 DESCRIPTION
 
+This is the Git.pm from github's git/git, which is a mirror of the git source.
+I (cpan msouth, or current maintainer) update the VERSION string here, and 
+maintain this little bit of POD.  That's it.  The only reason you would
+need this is if you are using something like Git::Hooks and you are using
+a perlbrewed (or otherwise separate) perl from the one git is using on your
+system (e.g. if you have a dev perl that's separate from system perl and git
+uses the system perl.  Then the Git.pm gets installed in the system lib and you
+have no way of getting it from CPAN, so your code that uses modules that 
+depend on it doesn't work).  Except for this paragraph and the VERSION
+string, this is just a copy of the latests version of perl/Git.pm from 
+https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/perl/Git.pm .  Or, at least, it should
+be--let me know if it's out of date and I hadn't noticed.)

 This module provides Perl scripts easy way to interface the Git version control
 system. The modules have an easy and well-tested way to call arbitrary Git
 commands; in the future, the interface will also provide specialized methods
