[MAINTAINER NOTE: This is Git.pm, plus the other files in the perl/Git directory,
from github's git/git., which is a mirror of the git source.  I (cpan msouth, or
current maintainer) update the VERSION string (necessary on CPAN because of another
CPAN distribution that confused the CPAN toolchain about which was the actual
official Git.pm), add this explanatory paragraph, and use Dist::Zilla to package
and release on CPAN.  The only reason that I know of that you would need this is
if you are using something like Git::Hooks and you are using a perlbrewed (or
otherwise separate) perl from the one git is using on your system (e.g. if you
have a dev perl that’s separate from system perl, and git uses the system perl.
Then the Git.pm gets installed in the system lib and you have no way of getting
it from CPAN, so your code--that uses modules that depend on Git.pm--doesn’t work).
I try to keep this up to date, so that if you do pull this from CPAN it will be,
hopefully, identical in functionality to the Git.pm and Git/*.pm from the git
distribution.  If that is not the case, contact me and I'll look into it.]
