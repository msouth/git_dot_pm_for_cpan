0.40  Sat Oct 11 02:35:10 CDT 2014
    - Adding Error.pm to prerequisites (should have been there all along, thanks Andreas Koenig https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=92422 )
    - Dropping the spurious requirement of 5.14 in Makefile.PL (thanks Gustavo L. de M. Chaves <gnustavo@cpan.org> for pointing that out)
    - Switching to .40 instead of .04 because of some conflict in another distro
    - Including the MYMETA files because PAUSE wanted them
